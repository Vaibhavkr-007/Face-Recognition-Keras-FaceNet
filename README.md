# Face Recognition using Keras-FaceNet

This project performs face recognition using the `keras-facenet` library. It includes two main scripts:

1. `create_embeddings.py`: Generates face embeddings from a set of labeled images.
2. `recognize_faces.py`: Recognizes faces in real-time using webcam feed based on saved embeddings.
